description: "<p>With 2380 sq.ft. built-up area, this makes a perfect house for a
  family looking for a premium 3BHK villa., with a spacious family living area in
  the first floor with 2 balconies on either side. Formal living area in the ground
  floor looks much bigger with the double-height feature. \n\n<p>We have a guest bathroom
  and 2 living rooms as standard feature in all our villas. “The Haven” villa project
  is just a couple of minutes’ drive from Kanjikuzhy, the most-happening place in
  Kottayam. This is located off SH-9, Kanjikuzhy-Puthupally Road. Only 1.7 kms away
  from Kanjikuzhy, it would take less than 5 minutes to reach any shopping centre
  or the schools in Kanjikuzhy.\n\n<p>Interiors are well designed. Luxurious bathrooms
  with open roof & live plants, big windows and contemporary style elevation all adds
  to the elegant looks of the villa. \n\n<p>Big windows allow a lot of natural light
  and ventilation. Exposure to natural light enhances your mood and boost your energy
  levels. It generally makes you feel better. All villas in “The Haven”, a premium
  villa project in Kottayam has incorporated this feature for the well-being of the
  resident.\n<p>Two spacious living rooms – a formal one that invites your guests
  in a formal way, and the family living room where you and family can gather during
  all your recreational time when at home – is a standard feature of all the villas
  in  “The Haven”, the luxury villa project in Kottayam. The common activity in your
  family living area is watching television, so we have ensured all the living rooms
  are spacious – almost 300-330 sq.ft. You can decorate your family living area with
  all your favourite furniture. A bean bag chair is perfect for the reading corner
  of your family living room.\n<p>We know storage is a big priority – hence Altin
  Properties have designed all interior spaces with 9-10 feet high ceilings. This
  can increase your storage either as big wardrobes or loft spaces.\n<p>The quickest
  and the cheapest way to reduce you home electricity bills is by going green. Provision
  of solar hot water lines in all bathrooms and kitchen makes the villas in “The Haven”
  a best choice for you, considering the priority of saving electricity and also in
  terms of the huge savings it can offer by reducing your energy bills.\n<p>It saves
  the homeowner a good amount of money in the long run as it doesn’t need to be replaced
  for years. Unlike hardwood, laminate flooring doesn’t fade in sunlight, and is resistant
  to stains and scratches due to the highly durable plastic wear layer on the top
  surface of laminate floors.\n<p>White is perfect choice for all seasons and all
  villas in this project are painted white. White walls go well with any type of decorations
  as well as it look carefree in bright accents. No other colour are quite as flexible
  as white.\n\n<p>We want your experience and the journey with us to be a great one,
  from your initial enquiry right through to moving into and living in your new Altin
  Villa.\n\n<p>Please speak to our Sales or CRM team or visit “The Haven”, a premium
