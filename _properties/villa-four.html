description: "<p> With a built-up area of 2268 sq.ft., this is a perfect option for
  anyone looking for a 4BHK villa in Kottayam less than 2400 sq.ft. It has a built-up
  area of 2268 sq.ft., with 4 bedrooms 5 bathrooms and 2 living rooms - one in the
  ground floor and a family living are in the upper floor.\n\n<p>This is one among
  the twelve luxury villas in Kanjikuzhy, offered by Altin Properties in the project
  \"The Haven\". Several options in 3BHK and 4HK are showcased here. This villa has
  2 lving rooms and a guest bathroom for the ultimate in comfort.\n\n<p>Living room
  at the first floor offers the best place for you to enjoy your time with family.
  It has ample space for seating and to set up your home theatre. \n\n<p>Most of us
  would agree that a house with floor to ceiling sliding windows tends to be more
  desirable than one with smaller and fewer windows. Large windows can allow light
  to stream in throughout the day. More than 500 sq.ft. of sliding windows with SS
  mesh contributes to the pleasant weather as well as natural light during the day
  inside every villa. It also provides the contemporary looks for all these 12 villas.
  Double-height formal living room is another positive element in the villa.\nThis
  villa is a combination of superb floor plan and premium build specifications. With
  the interiors done in traditional or contemporary way, you can be one of the proud
  owners of the best 4BHK villas in Kottayam. Elevation, floor plan and the interiors
  are carefully designed to make this villa superior in every ways compared to the
  ones available at higher price in the market.\n\n<p>Sliding windows and French doors
  from the brands like TORFENSTER/FENESTA adds to the character of the villa. We use
  only best quality floor and wall tiles – a good combination of vitrified and anti-skid
  ceramic tiles – from KAJARIA or NITCO. Other premium products we use in our project
  are ROCA wash basins, KOHLER/JAQUAR pressmatic basin spouts, HONEYWELL switches
  (USA), SHERWIN WILLIAMS Paints & Putty (USA) etc. Flooring designs showcase a beautiful
  combination of wooden laminates, vitrified & ceramic tile and granite etc. in all
  villas. Laminate wood floors gives the same looks of hardwood floor and are easy
  to maintain as it doesn’t require waxing, polishing, or detergents or abrasive cleaning.\nAll
  villas in “The Haven” is painted white – it gives you the freedom to change things
  as often as you wish without repainting. Especially in rooms where things are updated
  relatively often – for instance, bedroom and living room – this is very helpful.\n\n\n<p>These
  villas are eco-friendly as it serves to reduce your energy consumption. Solar water
  heaters offers a best cost-effective way to generate hot water for your kitchen
  and bathroom use. We have a parallel plumbing line in all villas in “The Haven”
  to cater to this need of the homeowner.\n<p>Rain water harvesting is made possible
  by having exquisite landscape designs, rather than concrete pavers. “The Haven”
  villa project in Kottayam offers luxury amenities like swimming pool with wooden
  deck and open party area in addition to health center and indoor games in its Clubhouse
  as well as many tree courts & a kid’s play area. Schools like Pallikoodam, Marian
  School, colleges & hospitals and other shopping avenues & hang-out destinations
