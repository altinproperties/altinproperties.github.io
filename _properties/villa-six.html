  - a formal living in the ground floor and family living room in first floor. Comfortable,
  well-lit seating in the formal living area in ground floor as you enter the house

  laminate flooring because it looks just like hardwood, but without the normal problems
  of hardwood – like high maintenance costs, or wear and tear. \n<p>When multiple
  rooms of a home are visible at once, the use of one colour - especially ‘white’
  which goes with everything - helps the space feel more serene. ‘White’ also makes
  compact spaces feel bigger.\n\n<p>At Altin Properties, our aim is that the Customer
