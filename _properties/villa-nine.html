description: "<p>Another superably designed 3BHK villa in Kottayam by Altin Properties!
  \n\n<p>It comes with 3 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 2 living rooms, utility area for the
  kitchen. It has a built-up area of 2368 sq.ft.\n\n<p>This is located by the Municipality
  Jubilee Road near Thuruthel Palam, Kanjikuzhy-Puthupally Road. Only 1.7 kms away
  from Kanjikuzhy, it would take less than 5 minutes to reach any shopping venues
  and the major colleges & schools in Kottayam.\n\n<p>Double-height of the formal
  living room lets you feel the area much bigger. Spacious bathrooms has several luxury
  elements, including sun roof with live plants. Deck adjacent to the dining area
  can be accessed through the French door. Good height of the rooms and large windows
  are other good features. \n<p>It is very essential to have 2 living rooms in your
  house to meet all your needs in today’s lifestyle – one to welcome your guests and
  the other one for you to hang out with your family and close friends to spend your
  evenings, or watch a movie with all of them. Above all, your family living rooms
  needs to offer comfort. Hence, Altin Properties made sure you have a big family
  living room in all villas in “The Haven”, the luxury villa project in Kottayam.
  Deep sofas and plump seats decorated with a line of bright-coloured soft cushions
  will entice the whole family to settle in and spend the good times together, rather
  than in separate rooms.\n<p>Wide doorways make your everyday life so much easier.
  We have all entrance doors 110 cm wide in all 12 villas.\n<p>One of major eco-friendly
  features of our villas is the large windows which lets in lots of natural daylight
  and allows air circulation without consuming electricity. All villa owners in our
  project “The Haven” enjoys this passive solar gain.\n<p>Few homeowners realize it
  – after air conditioning, it’s your hot water heaters that poses the biggest energy
  drain in your home. In most cases, the resistance in transitioning from the conventional
  ones to the solar water heater is the need for a lot of plumbing works. You don’t
  need to worry about this problem in our luxury villa project in Kanjikuzhy at all!\n<p>We
  have a right combination of tiles, granite and wooden laminates to add to the elegant
  look of the rooms. Laminate flooring doesn’t absorb dust like carpet and is very
  easy to clean. It doesn’t contract or expand like real hardwood does in the normal
  weather.\n<p>White is clean and simple. It makes any room look crisp and fresh and
  never look dated. All 3BHK and 4BHK villas in this premium villa project is painted
  white. It looks elegant in the bright sun of the summer and the slightly dull context
  in the winter.\n\n<p>Our CRM team offers assistance services including bank loan
  for funding the purchase, and interior design services. \n\n<p>Unlike typical floor
  plans and elevation in all plots as you see in most of the villa projects, we have
  9 different plans. You can reach us at +91-75111 73000 or write to us at contact@altinproperties.com\n"
