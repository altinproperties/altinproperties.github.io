  it has 4 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, two living rooms, a show kitchen and utility kitchen.
  View of the green fields from the backyard garden is so beautiful. Sit-out & Balcony
  at the back, overlooking the lush green, give a lot of comfort as well as privacy.\n\n<p>This
  is one of the biggest 4BHK villas in \"The Haven\", a luxury villa project in Kottayam,
  only a couple of minutes drive from Kanjikuzhy. The location of the project is very
  good. Kanjikuzhy is just 1.7 kms away and all reputed schools are within 2 kms from

  grand entrance and a beautiful living room, a well organised kitchen, a lovely family
  living area with a scenic sit-out/balcony and a beautiful outdoor entertainment
  area. Villa No: 12 in “The Haven”, probably the most premium villa project in Kottayam
  offers all these features to you. Being outdoors isn’t only enjoyable, it’s healthy
  too. A beautiful garden at your backyard is a great thing to have in your dream
  home. \n<p>Two living rooms have been incorporated in the floor plan - a formal
  living in the ground floor and family living room in first floor. In addition to
  the premium sanitary ware brands, the bathrooms has luxury elements like pergolas
  and live plants inside. \n\n<p>Around 10-feet tall ceiling works out magic, open
  up interiors without increasing built-up square footage, and generates a sense of
  comfort & pleasant atmosphere that the standard 8-feet ceilings lack. Every villa
  in our luxury project offers you this great feature. \n<p>This villa has approximately
  450-500 sq.ft. UPVC sliding windows which gives the contemporary looks as well as
  pleasant atmosphere inside the houses. As you know, sunlight is a mood-enhancer.
  Big, tall windows in all these 12 villas let lots of sunlight in during the day
  and there is good ventilation as well. Large windows can help you feel you are a
  part of the beautiful outdoors even when you are in inside the house. The stunning
  beauty of the outdoors can also be the backdrop of your family room décor.\n<p>Eco-friendly,

  is to install the piping which serves hot water to all bathrooms and kitchen. Homeowners
  in “The Haven”, the luxury villa project in Kottayam, doesn’t need to worry about
  this as we have already provided necessary piping for installing solar water heaters.\n<p>At
  Altin Properties, we considered the practicality aspect too before we chose the
  wooden laminate flooring instead of hardwood flooring. This easy-to-clean, low-maintenance,
  highly durable laminates are eco-friendly materials as well and hence a good element
  for our luxury villas in Kottayam.\n<p>White is the colour of Altin villas in its
  luxury villa project in Kottayam as the lack of colour leaves the focus on the angles
  of the structure itself. White is very elegant and appeals to all types of people.\n\n<p>Altin
