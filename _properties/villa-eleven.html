  \n\n<p>There are two living rooms incorporated in the floor plan - Formal living
  in the ground floor and family living room in first floor. Formal living area is
  an indispensable space in any house, however no one ever hangs out there as we tend
  to keep that area clean and tidy for welcoming our guests. For this very same reason,
  Altin Properties made presents two living rooms in all villas in “The Haven”, the
  luxury villa project in Kottayam. A low-height coffee table that can double up as
  a drawing table will be a good element in your family living area – for both kids
  and adults. Small arm chairs, bean bags, knitted pouffes, love seat etc. can add
  to the looks of your family living room; you can also get some plush carpet or rug
  that can transform the look of your living room. \n\n<p>In addition to the premium
  sanitary ware brands, the bathrooms has luxury elements like pergolas and live plants

  cover to give you peace of mind.\n<p>Solar water heating system is very efficient
  and can cheaply generate enough hot water for your needs once you have absorbed
  the cost of installing it. Major portion of this cost is incurred while you extend
  new pipes to all your bathrooms and kitchen. In our villas, there is a designated
  pipeline for hot water from solar water heater installed in your terrace. \n<p>In
