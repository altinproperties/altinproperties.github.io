description: "<p>This 3BHK overlooks lush green fields and it makes you feel fresh
  at all times during the day. This luxury villa with a built-up area of 2368 sq.ft.
  comes with a spacious family living area of approx. 320 sqft in the first floor,
  with 2 balconies on either side. \n\n<p>“The Haven” is  a two-minutes’ drive from
  Kanjikuzhy junction. If you are searching for a luxury villa in Kottayam, please
  visit “The Haven”, a premium villa project by Altin Properties, just 1.7 km away
  from Kanjikuzhy. \n<p>Double-height formal living room and dining area with a deck
  extension gives you ample space in the ground floor. Formal living area has big
  windows and the long curtains or blinds add luxury look to your home. Living room
  at the first floor offers the best place for you to enjoy your time with family.
  Family living room provides the much-needed space where the home owner’s family
  can spend time together – it suits for recreation and entertainment purposes. TV
  points are provided in both the living rooms, and today people tend to have more
  than one TV in their house. For utility and ease of use, telephone points /intercom
  equipment is also provided in both formal living and family living area. With more
  than 320 sq.ft. of carpet area and 1-2 balconies attached, the family living area
  serves to be one of the best areas within the house for all the residents– irrespective
  of the age. You can decorate the family living area with a lot of frames, pots,
  your favourite furniture and recliners.\n<p>You don’t need us to tell you storage
  is a basic need – our design of all rooms with more than 10 feet height lets you
  install lofts above the wardrobes. \n<p>Big windows is a simple way to bring the
  outdoors in. Everyone know that the views of the natural world have a positive effect
  on our health. This villa has approximately 500-600 sqft windows which gives the
  contemporary looks as well as pleasant atmosphere inside the houses.\n<p>In “The
  Haven”, the premium villa project at Kottayam, all villas have separate built-in
  lines for providing hot water to your bathroom, kitchen and work area. The true
  value of going green with solar hot water systems is not just the reduction of your
  energy bills, but a sustainable way for the future for all your energy needs.\n<p>Altin
  Properties have chosen the best brands for vitrified and ceramic tiles – walls &
  floors. Besides tiles, we have used granite, terracotta tiles, natural stone, cement
  pavers and wooden laminates for decorating wall and floor. Laminate floor plank’s
  HDF core is made of ecologically sustainable pine trees or industrial wood waste.
  Laminate flooring gives you the look and feel of exotic hardwood without the actual
  use of solid wood. \n<p>White works for all - for everyone who prefer a warm, cosy
  style as well as for those who like clean, crisp colour. A white wall provides the
  eye a place to rest when there are a lot of decors, making the overall vibe of the
  area feel fresh rather than distracting.\n\n<p>At Altin Properties, our aim is that
  the Customer receives excellent customer service and the best quality home.\n\n<p>There
  are 12 villas in the luxury villa project at Kottayam, \"The Haven\", and there
  are nine distinct elevations and floor plans. You can reach us at +91-75111 73000
