description: "<p>This medium-sized 3BHK suits everyone who wishes to own a beautiful
  house with built-up area less than 2000 sq.ft. The floor plan is amazing - 3 bedrooms,
  4 bathrooms and 2 living rooms, with a total built-up area of 1870 sq.ft. \n\n<p>This
  is located by the State Highway-9, Kanjikuzhy-Puthupally Road. Only 1.7 kms away
  from Kanjikuzhy, it would take less than 5 minutes to reach any shopping venues
  and the major colleges & schools (Pallikoodam, Marian School, Girideepam School,
  Mar Baselios School) in Kottayam. \n\n<p>Formal living room in the ground floor
  caters to all your regular needs and the family living room in first floor which
  offers great family entertainment space is the highlight of this villa. \n\n<p>The
  concept of 2 living rooms is materialised in all villas in the “The Haven”, the
  luxury villa project in Kottayam. In our luxury villa project in Kottayam - “The
  Haven”- Altin Properties has considered what elements you would need to set the
  style, layout and utility of your family living area to ensure everyone in your
  family finds this room an inviting space to relax in and enjoy their time. It can
  easily accommodate 2-3 families – if you don’t have the space for extra chairs,
  a leather pouffe or a bean bag can do the job. \n<p>Large windows provide visual
  access to the beautiful outdoors, allow in natural sunlight and can let you have
  fresh air. Altin Properties wonder if you would find these feature – approx. 500
  sq.ft. of tall & wide UPVC windows of a U.K. brand – in any of the other villas
  available for purchase in Kottayam.\n\n<p>In addition to the premium sanitary ware
  brands, the bathrooms has luxury elements like pergolas and live plants inside.
  Exterior deck next to the dining area is a good element - it offers you more space
  when you slide open the big UPVC french windows. Not many villas in Kottayam gives
  you these can boasts of these amazing features.\n\n<p>The build specs are really
  amazing! UPVC windows comes with 15 years warranty. We wonder if any other builder
  in Kottayam offers similar products. Properly planned spaces in design stages gives
  you really beautiful room interiors for your dream villa.  \n\n<p>White is the primary
  colour in “The Haven” as we think this colour is ideal for displaying art and collections.
  Whether you have an antique piece of original art you want to highlight, a collection
  of pottery, white walls puts the focus on your fabulous collections.\n\n<p>We have
  different types of flooring in all villas – vitrified and ceramic tiles of good
  brands, granite flooring and laminate wooden flooring. Laminate flooring not just
  offers the beauty of traditional hardwood, but also provides the added benefit of
  high durability and quick installation and low maintenance.\n\n<p>“The Haven”, a
  luxury villa project in Kottayam by Altin Properties, showcases eco-friendly 4BHK
  and 3BHK which helps the owner benefit from passive solar gains through additional
  plumbing lines for solar water heater.\nUnlike typical floor plans and elevation
  in all plots as you see in most of the villa projects, we have 9 different plans.
  All houses in this project has a formal living area, family living area and a guest
  bathroom.\n\n<p>Our CRM team offers assistance services including bank loan for
  funding the purchase, and interior design services. You can reach us at +91-75111
