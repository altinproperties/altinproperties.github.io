    a great community and a beautiful place to live. We really like the concept of
    several small tree courts, which provides enough space for all residents to enjoy
    the weather.

    and close proximity to the schools & hospitals. The quality of the workmanship
    in the villa is also really good.

  content: We visited many of the residential developments locally, as well as others
    around Kanjikuzhy; but we found Altin Properties by far the most professional,
    knowledgeable and friendly out of them all. The premium specs offered at much
    lesser price compared to market standards is what appealed to us the most.
